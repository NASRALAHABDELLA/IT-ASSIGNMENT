Security
Security meaning
Whenever a company, group or organization communicates online, by email or similar, and stores and transfers data and information, it must ensure its IT security. The scale of a cyber-attack is increasingly devastating and the risk of becoming a victim of a cyber-attack is growing every day. What dangers emanate from cyber-attacks and what areas does IT Security cover that protect against the growing threat of cyber-crime? Below, we provide information on the methods and tactics of hackers and the responsibilities of IT Security.
What is the objective of IT Security?
Information has become more and more valuable over the last few years. Therefore, it is all the more important to protect it. Information security is defined by the three IT protection goals of availability, integrity and confidentiality. These must be maintained. In addition, there are other parts to be added: Authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability.
•	Confidentiality: Protecting the privacy of data
•	Integrity: Ensuring that data has not been modified
•	Availability: Providing continual access to data and systems
Types of IT Security
IT security deals with all aspects of protecting IT assets against cyber threats. The modern business’s IT assets are spread across multiple different platforms, meaning that IT security must secure a wide range of different platforms from cybersecurity threats.
IT security includes:
Identity Security: Identity security includes methods and processes to identify, verify and authorize machines, devices, users, groups, applications, and functions. This is essential to identity and access management (IAM).
Network Security: Network security involves securing on-prem networks, wide area networks (WAN), and the Internet. Network segmentation, secure transport, secure access and content inspection to prevent threats are some methods used for securing networks.
Cloud Security: As organizations increasingly adopt cloud technologies, they need cloud-specific security solutions. Common aspects of cloud security include solutions for IaaS security (covering infrastructure and workloads), PaaS security (securing applications and containers), and SaaS security (protecting office suites and email).
Endpoint Security: As employees increasingly work from home, endpoint security is more important than ever. This includes device compliance and threat prevention for both traditional endpoints and mobile devices and securing Internet of Things (IoT) devices with device discovery, segmentation, and threat prevention.
Application and API Security: Applications and application programming interfaces (APIs) are a major part of an organization’s attack surface and should be secured via code review, analysis and runtime analytics. In the modern organization, security is no longer bolted on or added as an overlay on top of Infrastructure as Code but is included in the CI/CD pipelines as part of Shift Left Security and DevSecOps initiatives.
Management: Deploying an array of security solutions means that organizations need to manage them as well. This includes device configuration, monitoring, optimization, automation, and orchestration.
Visibility and Incident Response: The goal of IT security is to protect the organization against cyber threats. To do so, organizations need to maintain visibility into their network, ingest threat intelligence, and engage in forensics, threat hunting, and threat mitigation as needed.
Vulnerability Exploitation: IT assets commonly run software that contains potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals can take advantage of this by attacking these systems directly over the network or sending malicious files to exploit the vulnerabilities.
Account Takeover: Cybercriminals can steal account credentials via phishing and other social engineering attacks. With these credentials, attackers can take over user accounts to steal sensitive data or use them in their attacks.
Financially-Motivated Attacks: Cybercrime is a business with many opportunities to make money. These include ransomware, data exfiltration, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks for financial extortion.
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): APTs are sophisticated threat actors financed by nation-states or organized crime. These groups can launch very sophisticated attacks, such as exploitation of supply chain vulnerabilities.
Poor Security Practices: Lax security configurations and access controls are a common problem in both on-perm and cloud-based environments. Examples include the use of default and weak credentials exploitable via brute force attacks.
IT Security Vs Cybersecurity
IT security and cybersecurity are closely related. Both address the security of an organization’s IT assets and the data that they contain, and this includes protecting these assets against digital threats. IT may also include measures to secure IT from physical threats.The main difference between IT security and cybersecurity is that cybersecurity goes beyond IT security. 
Cyber Attack Methods: What attacks exist?
Cyber-crime is constantly changing and new methods are being developed to identify and exploit security holes. In general, IT Security is asymmetric: in order to significantly damage a company’s operating procedures, a cyber-criminal must successfully exploit a single weakness.
Companies, on the other hand, have to ensure comprehensive protection to safeguard their IT security.
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) means “advanced and persistent threat”. Hackers use a lot of time, effort and resources to penetrate a system. First they infiltrate a computer to spy on internal processes and from there they sabotage the entire network. This gives cyber-criminals permanent access to a network and from there they can spread more malware to attack the entire system. 
Malware 
Malware can be any type of malicious program that can cause damage to infected systems. These include worms, viruses, Trojans and ransomware programs. Wanna Cry, Peaty and Ryuk in particular have demonstrated in recent years that malware is quite capable of bringing companies to the brink of closure or even insolvency if IT Security is inadequate. More about malware you can read here.
Phishing
Phishing is an attempt at fraud carried out electronically, in which a fake email is sent to the recipient, who often does not recognize it as such at first. This method of cyber-attack, in the form of a professional looking email, is often designed to trick the recipient into revealing confidential data. Learn more about phishing here.
What is Critical Infrastructure?
Critical infrastructures are the companies, organizations and facilities that are essential for the maintenance of essential social functions, health, security and economic and social well-being of the population. They include, for example, energy and water companies, logistics companies, hospitals and the financial sector.

IT Security Conclusion
Cybercrime has an increasing impact on a country’s economic and political processes. The consequences of cyber-attacks show through numerous incidents that IT Security is indispensable in today’s world. If the three objectives of protecting confidentiality, integrity or availability are not met, this can have devastating effects on the profitability of a company.
Types of hacker’s
White hat hackers
A white hat hacker, also known as an ethical hacker, is a computer security expert who hacks into computer systems, networks, or applications with the intent of finding and fixing security vulnerabilities.
 Black hat hackers
Black hat hackers are cybercriminals who orchestrate scams and exploit vulnerabilities with the intent to cause harm. The aim of black hat hackers is usually to make money. They do this in many ways, but most involve stealing money outright, cracking passwords to access information that can be sold on the dark web, or holding sensitive data for ransom.
Gray hat hackers
Gray hats exist in an ambiguous ethical hacking area between white and black. These hackers infiltrate systems without their targets’ consent, but they don’t exploit vulnerabilities to cause harm. Instead, they inform the victims of the hack in order to help them improve their security.
But gray hat hackers don’t always share this information for free
Red hat hackers
Red hat hackers see themselves as the “superheroes” of the hacking world. They typically target black hat hackers to disrupt their attacks or retaliate against them. While red hat hackers are staunchly anti-black hats, they use similar techniques to hack black hat rings or individuals. They may launch full-scale attacks to destroy black hat servers or steal their resources and return them to those who’ve been wronged.
 Blue hat hackers
Blue hat hackers are white hat hackers who are employed by an organization. Their job is to maintain the cybersecurity of the organization and prevent attacks. Blue hats are not usually called “hackers” once they’re employed by an organization or company.
Blue hats often work as part of a team, and they may not be responsible for carrying out hacks on their own. They usually work for IT departments in large companies. Or they may work for cybersecurity agencies that sell white hat hacking services to clients.
 Hacktivists
Hacktivists are people who hack into systems to fight back against perceived political or social injustice. Hacktivists often try to expose government or corporate malfeasance by hacking into secure systems and exposing secret information.
The most famous hacktivist group is Anonymous, which has hacked many organizations including the Church of Scientology, the US Federal Reserve, and governments around the world to protest against apparent injustice.
Those who engage in hacktivism almost always intend to cause reputational damage or some other form of harm to their victims, even if they believe their intention is to promote the greater good.
